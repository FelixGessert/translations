## Adding a new locale

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a file with a name of a language code in each folder right next to existing translations. For example, for a Spanish language you need to create a `es.json` file in each folder.
3. Make a Pull Request.

### Recommendations

For making a translation process simpler, we recommend copy and pasting existing translations, for example, English, onto a newly created file and then translate.
